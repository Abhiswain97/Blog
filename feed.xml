Actually, it’s not “Rust v/s C++” as in comparison of the languages, but I just want a language for understanding the underpinnings of deep learning algorithms. I want to build them from scratch or atleast try, so that I have a better understanding. One of my favorite physicists, Richard Feynman said something I resonate with a lot: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/images/rustvscpp.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/images/rustvscpp.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Importance of a proper posture</title><link href="https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/health/lifestyle/2020/07/10/importance-of-posture.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Importance of a proper posture" /><published>2020-07-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/health/lifestyle/2020/07/10/importance-of-posture</id><author><name></name></author><category term="health" /><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">Today I want to talk about something I had a really bad time with.

I was very naive to think that it was pretty simple to do and maybe it is for many people but guess I belong to the latter category where you gotta struggle to do it. Well the bottom line is, I want to get things in order. It’s not like I have not tried to do it before but there was just so much happening around me, I mean from classes, seminar, minor project to placements, major presentation etc that I couldn’t pause to think about where I am in life and what I want to do moving forward. So, this lockdown period for me was like brakes applied to a car moving at a great speed, it’s kind of pretty sudden and shakes you up but if you think about it maybe it was required?. I think that was the worst analogy I could come up with, but I really am not very good with words. Basically, this lockdown got me pausing and thinking. I wont lie, it was rather frustrating in the beginning because I was used to go walking, running &amp;amp; stuff I did because I wanted to be a “fit 💪 guy” but now that it has been quite sometime I feel it has done me a lot of good. Like I said maybe the brakes were required?. So, let’s begin !</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/images/discipline.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://abhiswain97.github.io/blog/images/discipline.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
